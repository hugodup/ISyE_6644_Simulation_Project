# Simulation_Project_ISYE_6644

this research project aims to build a library where users would be able to produce random variates for discrete and continuous distributions routines in Python.

The code is divided in different parts:
-Discrete Distribution's Random variates
-Continuous Distribution's Random variates
-Generating Stats and Graphs
-Technical part

As we read along the code, small descriptions have been provided to clarify what we are aiming to do.

Please kindly not that this small program will be used in the foundation of a package online.
